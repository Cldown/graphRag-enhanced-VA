It is employed to represent categorical data using bars, where each bar corresponds to a category and can be considered an event or a specific data point within the dataset.\",5\r\n22,GINI,\"The GINI is a measure of statistical dispersion that is widely utilized to represent income inequality. It is a metric that ranges from 0.266 to 0.381 and is frequently employed in economic analysis and reports. In the context of relationships, the GINI is associated with concepts and events related to economic inequality and statistical analysis.\",3\r\n5,RANGE,\"RANGE is a statistical concept that indicates an event or category encompassing a spread of values in a dataset. It is specifically a measure that calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values found within the dataset. In certain contexts, RANGE can span from as low as 0.001 to as high as 1.884, demonstrating the diversity of values that might be included in the dataset.\",3\r\n131,FIRST QUARTILE,\"The term \"\"FIRST QUARTILE\"\" refers to a statistical event or concept that represents the first quartile of a dataset. It is an event or category related to the top 25% of the lowest values within the dataset when it is divided into four equal parts. This indicates the threshold below which 25% of the data points fall.\",2\r\n130,NORMALIZED RANGE,,1\r\n84,MAX,\"MAX is a concept or event in statistical analysis that refers to the highest value observed within a dataset. In the context of the provided information, the MAX value ranges from 639.070 to 26214.494, indicating the extent of the maximum limit found in the data.\",2\r\n11,SIXTH-ORDER MOMENT,\"The \"\"SIXTH-ORDER MOMENT\"\" is a statistical measure that represents the sixth moment of a distribution. It is an entity that can be associated with a data set from a research institution. The value of the SIXTH-ORDER MOMENT ranges from 44125102529.899 to 131908579289215120000, indicating the extent of its measurement in the distribution.\",1\r\n172,HASOUTLIERS_1_99,\"The entity referred to as \"\"HASOUTLIERS_1_99\"\" is a concept that pertains to the existence of outliers within statistical datasets. Additionally, the term can be interpreted as a designation for an organization or study that specializes in researching or dealing with these exceptional data points. Thus, \"\"HASOUTLIERS_1_99\"\" could signify both a theme in data analysis and a possible group or research area dedicated to understanding and managing outliers.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n51,BOX,_OUTLIERS,\"_outliers are a part of box plot analysis, indicating a relationship in statistical visualization>\",13\r\n118,BAR,QUANTITATIVE,Quantitative data can be represented in a bar chart for categorical comparison,11\r\n25,SCATTER,_OUTLIERS,\"_outliers can be identified in a scatter plot, indicating a relationship in data analysis>\",10\r\n121,BAR,_OUTLIERS,\"_outliers can be represented in a bar chart, indicating a relationship in data representation>\",8\r\n44,GINI,BAR,Gini coefficient is represented by a bar plot,8\r\n26,RANGE,HEATMAP,The range is sometimes represented in a heatmap,8\r\n120,BAR,FIRST QUARTILE,The first quartile is represented by a bar plot,7\r\n119,BAR,NORMALIZED RANGE,The normalized range is represented by a bar plot,6\r\n28,RANGE,FIRST QUARTILE,The first quartile and the range are related statistical measures that describe the spread of data,5\r\n43,GINI,NORMALIZED_MEAN,NORMALIZED_MEAN and GINI both provide measures of central tendency and inequality in a dataset,5\r\n27,RANGE,MAX,MAX is the highest value within the RANGE of values in a dataset,5\r\n32,SIXTH-ORDER MOMENT,GINI,Both entities could be related as part of a comprehensive data analysis report,4\r\n128,MAX,HASOUTLIERS_1_99,The concept of outliers could be applied to the analysis of maximum values,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
