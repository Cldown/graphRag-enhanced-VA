Specifically, it involves calculating the percentage of data points that are considered outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR) and extends to three interquartile ranges. This entity studies the distribution of data to determine the proportion of outliers within this range, which has been observed to vary from 0.805 to 0.900. Therefore, \"\"PERCENT_OUTLIERS_3IQR\"\" can be understood as both a method for identifying outliers and an organization or project dedicated to researching these statistical anomalies.\",3\r\n17,MEAN,\"The MEAN is a statistical concept that represents the average value of a dataset. It is a measure of the mean value observed across various ranges, initially between 4.191 and 31.850, then expanding to between 31.850 and 281.886, and finally reaching from 281.886 to 8262.562. The term MEAN can also refer to an event or category related to the mean of a dataset. Ultimately, it denotes the average value derived from a set of numbers.\",4\r\n1,MED_ABS_DEV,\"MED_ABS_DEV is a term that refers to the median absolute deviation from the median of a dataset, which is a robust measure of statistical dispersion. It is a statistical term that could be associated with a research group or project and is also used to describe an event or category related to the median absolute deviation in a dataset. Overall, MED_ABS_DEV encapsulates the concept of quantifying the spread of data points around the median using their absolute differences.\",4\r\n6,AVG_ABS_DEV,\"The entity \"\"AVG_ABS_DEV\"\" refers to a statistical measure that calculates the average absolute deviation of a set of data points from their mean. It serves as an indicator of the dispersion or spread of the dataset around the central tendency. The value of AVG_ABS_DEV can range from 21.806 to 2579.857, indicating the variability in the dataset. Additionally, AVG_ABS_DEV can also be considered an event or category related to the assessment of average absolute deviation in a dataset, providing a comprehensive view of the deviations from the mean.\",3\r\n15,NORMALIZED_RANGE,\"The term \"\"NORMALIZED_RANGE\"\" refers to a measure that characterizes the range of values after normalization to a specific scale. It is a concept that can be associated with statistical methods or possibly an organization that employs such methods. This term encompasses the idea of standardizing data by adjusting the range to better facilitate comparison and analysis.\",2\r\n109,HAS_OUTLIERS,An event indicating the presence of outliers in the dataset>,1\r\n18,NORMALITY_P,NORMALITY_P is a statistical measure that quantifies the probability that a given dataset follows a normal distribution.
