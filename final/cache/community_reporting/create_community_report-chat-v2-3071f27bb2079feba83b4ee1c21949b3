This measure ranges from 1.760 to 5.826, indicating a scope of variability in the data. It can also be considered as an event or category related to the analysis of the dataset's coefficient of variation.\",3\r\n78,STD,\"The entity referred to as \"\"STD\"\" is a measure of the standard deviation of a dataset. It represents the amount of variation or dispersion within the data, with values ranging from 28.329 to 3000.465. The term \"\"STD\"\" is associated with statistical methods used to calculate standard deviation and can also refer to an event or category related to this statistical concept.\",2\r\n13,VAR,\"VAR is a term that can represent a measure of the variance of a dataset, which is a statistical calculation used to quantify the spread or dispersion between numbers within the dataset. It is also a potential abbreviation that could stand for \"\"variable\"\" or could be the name of an organization with a focus on statistical variance. In its primary context, VAR refers specifically to the variance itself, providing a useful metric to understand the diversity and range of values within a set of data points.\",2\r\n178,HASOUTLIERS_15IQR,A concept related to the presence of outliers in statistical data|,1\r\n79,LIN_SPACE_SEQUENCE_COEFF,The entity known as LIN_SPACE_SEQUENCE_COEFF is a coefficient that pertains to the linearity of a sequence of data points.
