{"result": "Based on the provided text data, which seems to be a collection of statistical values and data analysis terms, I will identify entities and relationships as per the given instructions.

(\"relationship\"<|>PERCENT_OUTLIERS_3IQR<|>HASOUTLIERS_3IQR<|>Both entities relate to the detection of outliers in a dataset<|>5)\n##\n5. (\"relationship\"<|>RANGE<|>MEDIAN<|>Range provides the spread of data, while median provides the central tendency, indicating a complementary relationship in data summary<|>2)\n##\n\nPlease note that the strength scores are arbitrary and for illustrative purposes only, as the text does not provide enough context to accurately score the strength of these relationships.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.
