{"result": "The entity \"PERCENT_OUTLIERS_3IQR\" refers to an event, category, or project focused on the statistical analysis of outliers. Specifically, it involves calculating the percentage of data points that are considered outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR) and extends to three interquartile ranges. This entity studies the distribution of data to determine the proportion of outliers within this range, which has been observed to vary from 0.805 to 0.900. Therefore, \"PERCENT_OUTLIERS_3IQR\" can be understood as both a method for identifying outliers and an organization or project dedicated to researching these statistical anomalies.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
