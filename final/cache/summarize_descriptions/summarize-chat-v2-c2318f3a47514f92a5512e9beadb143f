{"result": "Skewness is a statistical measure that quantifies the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. It provides insight into the distribution's lack of symmetry, indicating the extent to which the data distribution deviates from being perfectly normal or bell-shaped.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
