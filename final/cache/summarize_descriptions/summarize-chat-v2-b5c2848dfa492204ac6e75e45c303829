{"result": "RANGE is a statistical concept that indicates an event or category encompassing a spread of values in a dataset. It is specifically a measure that calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values found within the dataset. In certain contexts, RANGE can span from as low as 0.001 to as high as 1.884, demonstrating the diversity of values that might be included in the dataset.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
