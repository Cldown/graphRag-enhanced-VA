{"result": "COEFF_VAR is a term associated with an organization or project that deals with the coefficient of variation, a statistical measure representing the relative variability of a dataset. This measure ranges from 1.760 to 5.826, indicating a scope of variability in the data. It can also be considered as an event or category related to the analysis of the dataset's coefficient of variation.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
