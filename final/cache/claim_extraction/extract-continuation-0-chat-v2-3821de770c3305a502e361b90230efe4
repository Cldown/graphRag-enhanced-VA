Additionally, I've included claims for the geo location of events, assuming that the \"geo,event,organization\" relation implies a location for the event. Please note that the weight for these additional claims is assumed to be the same as the weight associated with the original claim that led to the discovery of these entities. If that is not the case, the weights would need to be adjusted accordingly.", "input": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.  Add them below using the same format:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4", "temperature": 0.95, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": [{"role": "user", "content": "---\n\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst analyze claims against certain entities and their associated attributes, presented in a structured text format.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a structured text input in the format Entity,Relation,Entity,Weight, extract all entities and treat both the subject and object entities, as well as the relation, as independent entities. The **third column** represents the **main entity** (i.e., the visualization type or target entity), while the **first column** represents an associated property or attribute of the main entity. The relation will be treated as a property that links the first column to the third column. The **fourth column** (Weight) represents a **weight** or frequency value, which should influence the significance of the relationship between the entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Parse Input Format:\n   - The input consists of rows structured as Entity,Relation,Entity,Weight, where:\n     - The first column represents the **attribute entity** (i.e., a property or characteristic).  \n     - The second column represents the **relation** (this will link the first column to the third column).  \n     - The third column represents the **main entity** (i.e., the visualization type or primary entity).  \n     - The fourth column represents the **weight** (indicating the frequency or significance of the relationship).\n\n2. Entity Identification:\n   - Identify both the **attribute entity** and the **main entity** from each row.  \n   - The **main entity** (third column) should be the primary entity in the output.  \n   - The **attribute entity** (first column) should be treated as an associated property or attribute of the main entity, linked through the relation (second column).  \n   - Special attention should be given to the trace_type relation, which specifies how the entity is visualized (e.g., scatter, bar, line). This will be treated as a key property of the main entity.\n\n3. Handle Duplicate Rows:\n   - If a row appears multiple times, the relationship (e.g., data_type) should have its weight increased accordingly. Reflect this by counting the number of occurrences and making the relationship more significant in the output. The weight value from the fourth column should be added to the relationship as a **weight**.\n\n4. Claim Extraction:\n   - For each row, extract the claim details based on the main entity and its associated attribute entity.  \n   - For each claim, extract the following information:  \n     - Subject: The **main entity** (third column), capitalized.\n     - Object: The **attribute entity** (first column), capitalized. If the object is a value or non-entity, use **NONE**.\n     - Claim Type: A category based on the relation (e.g., if the relation is data_type, the claim type will be **DATA TYPE**).\n     - Claim Status: Set to **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**, depending on the certainty of the claim.\n     - Claim Description: A detailed description of the claim, based on the relation and entities.\n     - Claim Date: The date or date range associated with the claim in ISO-8601 format (start_date, end_date). If unknown, use **NONE**.\n     - Claim Source Text: The entire row as the source text for the claim.\n     - Claim Weight: The weight value from the fourth column will be included as the **claim weight**.\n\n5. Output Format:\n   - Each extracted claim should be formatted as:  \n     (main_entity<|>attribute_entity<|>claim_type<|>claim_status<|>claim_start_date<|>claim_end_date<|>claim_description<|>claim_source<|>claim_weight)\n   - Use ## to separate multiple claims.\n   - End the output with <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\nExample Input:\n\nstring,data_type,scatter,20  \nstring,data_type,bar,15  \ndecimal,data_type,bar,16  \n\n\nEntity specification: data_type\nClaim description: Entity visualization and properties\n\nExample Output:\n\n(scatter<|>string<|>data_type<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>When data_type is string, scatter is used for visualization.<|>string,data_type,scatter<|>20)\n##  \n(bar<|>string<|>data_type<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>When data_type is string, bar is used for visualization.<|>string,data_type,bar<|>15)\n##  \n(bar<|>decimal<|>data_type<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>When data_type is decimal, bar is used for visualization.<|>decimal,data_type,bar<|>16)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\nUse the following input for your answer.  \nEntity specification: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']\nClaim description: Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\nInput Text:\n\n{Entity,Relation,Entity,Weight}\n\nOutput:\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided real data input format, let's assume the following input text is given:\n\n```\norganization,headquarters,geo,50  \nperson,memberOf,organization,30  \ngeo,event,organization,20  \nevent,date,2022-01-01,10  \norganization,industry,finance,40  \nperson,role,analyst,25  \norganization,industry,technology,35  \nevent,date,2023-05-15,15  \ngeo,event,organization,22  \n```\n\nThe following would be the output following the steps and format specified:\n\n```\n(geo<|>organization<|>HEADQUARTERS<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The organization's headquarters are located in the geo entity.<|>organization,headquarters,geo<|>50)\n##  \n(organization<|>person<|>MEMBER OF<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The person is a member of the organization.<|>person,memberOf,organization<|>30)\n##  \n(organization<|>geo<|>EVENT<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The organization is associated with an event in the geo entity.<|>geo,event,organization<|>20)\n##  \n(event<|>NONE<|>DATE<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-01<|>2022-01-01<|>The event occurred on this date.<|>event,date,2022-01-01<|>10)\n##  \n(organization<|>finance<|>INDUSTRY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The organization is in the finance industry.<|>organization,industry,finance<|>40)\n##  \n(person<|>analyst<|>ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The person has the role of an analyst.<|>person,role,analyst<|>25)\n##  \n(organization<|>technology<|>INDUSTRY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The organization is in the technology industry.<|>organization,industry,technology<|>35)\n##  \n(event<|>NONE<|>DATE<|>TRUE<|>2023-05-15<|>2023-05-15<|>The event occurred on this date.<|>event,date,2023-05-15<|>15)\n##  \n(organization<|>geo<|>EVENT<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The organization is associated with an event in the geo entity (second instance).<|>geo,event,organization<|>22)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n```\n\nPlease note that the \"Claim Date\" field has been filled with the date from the relation \"event,date\" since that seems to be the only date-related information provided in the input.
